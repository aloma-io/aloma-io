# Developer Platform

## Welcome to ALOMA Documentation

ALOMA is a **code-first workflow automation platform** designed for developers who want the flexibility of code without the overhead of managing infrastructure.

Unlike visual tools that require dragging blocks together, ALOMA lets you:

* Trigger automations with JSON
* Write logic in JavaScript
* Scale workflows dynamically with minimal setup

This documentation will help you get started quickly, explore core concepts, and build advanced automations with ALOMA.
