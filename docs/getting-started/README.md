# Getting Started with ALOMA

## Resources

This ReadMe provides an overview of how ALOMA works, read it to get a basic understanding of the ALOMA Automation Flow.

- The [toy example](https://github.com/aloma-io/aloma-io/blob/main/docs/getting-started/toy-example.md) applies these basics and sets up commands using the example of offloading a ship.
- [Workspace](https://github.com/aloma-io/aloma-io/blob/main/docs/getting-started/workspaces.md) are the environments where automations run. 
- [Integrations](https://github.com/aloma-io/aloma-io/blob/main/docs/getting-started/integration.md) get data in and out of ALOMA through connectors (authorised, reusable wrappers to external services including API) and Webhooks.
- [Tasks](https://github.com/aloma-io/aloma-io/blob/main/docs/getting-started/tasks.md) are data that trigger workflows to be built and automated.  
- [Steps](https://github.com/aloma-io/aloma-io/blob/main/docs/getting-started/steps.md) are the individual code steps that form a workflow.
